## Features


<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Minimal" icon="information">
		It's truly minimal, avoiding unnecessary language features, such as
    safety and reliability. Also, good luck making portable code as its
    all platform specific.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Ride like lightning, Crash like thunder!" icon="rocket">
    Desipit directly compiling to x86_64 naive code and not having a GC,
    it miserably fails at generating optimal code and is probably slower 
    and leaks more memory than python and javascript combined.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Direct Control" icon="setting">
    Like an f1 car, in the hands of the uninitialised, you will
    crash and burn along with your program and CPU thread.
		Shard's allows you to directly control hardware registers 
    meaning that your program executes in the way you _thought_ 
    you intented.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Written in Rust" icon="seti:rust">
    The Shard compiler leverages Rust's unique feature set
    to deliver the best combination of reliability and speed. Contrary
    to its predecessor, it actually _isn't_ safe.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Makes the World Warmer" icon="sun">
    By directly including a crypto miner, it makes the world a
    warmer, cozier place, just like your server room.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Numeric type system" icon="puzzle">
    Shard cleverly leverages new concepts such as an algebraic type 
    system by completely rejecting them. We only have bytes and
    floats as this keeps you from doing too much abstraction and
    being productive.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fearful concurrency" icon="error">
    No threads unless youre brave enough to use pthread.h, or code
    your own just like how unix wanted you to.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
